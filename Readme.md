# Nand2Tetris Journey

This repository is my follow-along work for **Elements of Computing Systems** (a.k.a. *Nand2Tetris*).
It contains my implementations, experiments, and notes as I progress through each project in the course.

## Purpose
- Document my learning process and milestones.
- Keep track of solutions, improvements, and alternative approaches.
- Serve as a personal reference for future hardware/software projects.

## Structure
- **projects/** – Completed assignments and supporting files.
- **tools/** – Nothing, just the tools and stubs from original nand2tetris repo.
- **projects/playground/** – Side explorations and additional tools/scripts.

Work in progress – evolving as I learn more.
